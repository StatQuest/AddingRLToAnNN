    "In this tutorial we illustrate how to add **Reinforcement Learning** (**RL**) to a simple **Neural Network**. Specifically, we illustrate how to add the **Policy Gradients** **RL** method to a **Neural Network** that is designed to help us decide where to go eat fries, either **'Squatch's Fry Shack** or **Norm's Fry Hut**, based on how hungry we are. If we are very hungry, than we will want to go to the place that has a high probability of giving us a large order of fries. However, if we are not very hungry, we want to go to the place that has a low probability of giving us a large order of fries.\n",
